            Awareness For Food Management</h2>
        <p style="font-size: larger;color:orange;font-style: italic;">
          Food management is the process of planning, organizing, and
          controlling food resources to ensure efficiency, quality, and
          sustainability. It involves proper storage, preparation, and
          distribution of food while minimizing waste and ensuring nutritional
          value. Effective food management is essential in households,
          restaurants, and large-scale industries to maintain food safety,
          reduce costs, and meet dietary needs. This practice also plays a
          crucial role in addressing global food security by promoting
          sustainable sourcing, reducing food loss, and encouraging responsible
          consumption. By implementing smart strategies such as portion control,
          inventory tracking, and meal planning, food management helps create a
          balanced and efficient food system.
